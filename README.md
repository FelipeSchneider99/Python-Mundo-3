# 🐍 Python 3 - World 3

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises developed during **World 3** of the **Python 3 Course**, offered by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/) and taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara.

## 📋 About the Repository

"World 3" focuses on **Compound Data Structures** (Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries) and **Routines** (Functions and Modularization), enabling the creation of more complex and organized programs.

All codes were written in **Python**, focusing on logic and syntax mastery.
